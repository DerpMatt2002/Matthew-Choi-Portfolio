# Matthew-Choi-

this portfolio is a compilation of all the engineering/coding work that 
I, Matthew Choi have done so far as shown on my resume

Do note that some Cadence/Exensio files are not present 

Specifically:

I do not have access to the TSMC 65 pdk projects anymore, since I signed an NDA allowing
them to remove all projects using that pdk at the end of the semester.

The same goes for exensio, but a large majority of the exensio work was done through python's
jupyter notebook by downloading datasets and debugging
