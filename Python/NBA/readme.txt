This directory is a personal project involving me using the NBA api database to
make ML models that can as accurately certain statistics 

For example, the Top 75 Predictor will use a mix of one hot encoding,
XGBOOST, and correlation analysis to determine the variables highest correlated to
being a top 75 player of all time, as well as ranking the players who have
the highest odds of being a top 75 player
