This folder contains python files that I have developed to help analyze 
root cause analysis of wafer/die errors

The code mainly uses a mix of XGBOOST, random tree, regression, and lightgbm
to train/test the dataset

Other coding practices such as One Hot Encoding and Correlation Analysis are
used to find potential links regarding the variables that are highly linked to what
we assume is the root cause
