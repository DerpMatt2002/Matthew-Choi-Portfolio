Increased the Reach of the robot with a brand new weapon as well as doing the following:

- Brand new AM32 ESCs(the MK4 ones were not bidirectional)
- Power Switch addition(to easily turn on/off the robot)
- Brand new Weapon with increased reach
- Brand new Weapon Motor(to massively increase attack power)

Need to improve on:
- reduce weight of gearbox
- wiring is NOT optimized for reassembly
