A scrapped design that never made it past CAD phase

This design was abandoned for the following reasons:
- It was designed to keep as much of Tartarus mk 2 intact as possible
- Motor mount positioning was a major concern
- Did not address flaw of being able to flip
- MAJOR concerns with weight limit
