MK4 is a complete redesign of Tartarus that did the following:

- Get new ESCs(not BLHELI32) for better connection
- Manufacture a new weapon(beater bar for more consistent attacks while sacrificing reach)
- Go from UHMW to TPU(allows 3d printing possiblities, and is more durable, but is also flexible(not optimal for joints)
- Completely revamp chassis to adapt to change in weapon design
- Carbon Fiber Plating to lose excess weight

To improve:
- Increase reach of weapon
- Reduce size of LIPO battery
- Fix chassis according to new weapon design
