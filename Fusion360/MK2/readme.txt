The MK2 attempts to improve on the MK1 by doing the following:

- Changing weapon motor into a hub motor variation(merge the pulley with the motor) to prevent loosening
- Extend UHMW armor to fully protect the back wheels of the robot
- replace aluminum side hinges with standoffs for firmer UHMW side plate connection to the chassis
