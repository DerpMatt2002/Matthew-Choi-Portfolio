The MK2 attempts to improve on the MK1 by doing the following:

- Changing weapon motor into a hub motor variation(merge the pulley with the motor) to prevent loosening
- Extend UHMW armor to fully protect the back wheels of the robot
- replace aluminum side hinges with standoffs for firmer UHMW side plate connection to the chassis
- increase width of front titanium plates for more broad connections:

We learned from competing that:
- the UHMW armor actually completely prevented us from recovering from flipping
- the front titanium plates were NOT optimal for assembly(especially the bolt connection next to the weapon plates)
- The hub motor had 3d printed pulley material which sheered off 
- electronic packing was a NIGHTMARE
- our weapon was not the most optimal(low moment of inertia + RPM)
